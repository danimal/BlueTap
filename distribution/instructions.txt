INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download the zip file for your application from WideZero:

http://widezero.com/grabbag/BlueTap-1.0.zip


2. Open the zip file and you should see two files: 
    - BlueTap.mobileprovision
    - BlueTap.app
    
   i. Drag the BlueTap.mobileprovision file and drop 
      it on your iTunes icon (usually in the doc at the bottom of 
      your screen) or into iTunes itself. Choose to replace the existing 
      copy of BlueTap if it asks.
    
   ii. Drag the BlueTap.app file and drop it on the iTunes icon as well.
    
   iii. Open iTunes and click on the Applications tab to check. You 
        should see an icon with the name BlueTap. The icon will be for
        a default application. Don't worry, this will be the correct icon
        on your device.

3. Connect your iPhone or iPod touch to your computer.

   i. If it does not synch automatically and attempt to install your 
      new beta app, click on its icon under Devices in the iTunes left 
      hand column.
    
   ii. Once you have the device selected, Click on its Applications 
       tab in iTunes. You should see the app you are beta testing in 
       the grayed out list with the checkboxes. Make sure Sync 
       applications is checked, and All applications is selected. (if 
       you are using checkboxes, you need to make sure BlueTap is 
       checked, along with all the other apps you want to keep on your 
       device)

   iii. Click the Sync button in the lower right and watch the top 
        bar. You should eventually see it installing the beta 
        application on your device.
