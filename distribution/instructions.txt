INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download the zip file for your application from WideZero:

http://widezero.com/download/BlueTap-1.0e.zip

2. Open the zip file and you should see the following:
    On Mac, two files:
    - BlueTap.mobileprovision
    - BlueTap.app
    
    On Windows, at least file and one directory:
    - BlueTap.mobileprovision
    - BlueTap.app (directory)
    (don't worry about other files or directories)
    
   i. Drag the BlueTap.mobileprovision file and drop 
      it on your iTunes icon (usually in the doc at the bottom of 
      your screen) or directly into the iTunes app where it says
      "Library". Choose to replace the existing copy of BlueTap if 
      it asks.
    
   ii. Drag the BlueTap.app file/directory and drop it on the iTunes 
       icon as above.
    
   iii. Open iTunes and click on the Applications tab to check. You 
        should see an icon with the name BlueTap. The icon will be for
        a default application (an 'A' made of a ruler, pencil, and
        paintbrush). Don't worry, this will be replaced with the correct 
        icon on your device.

3. Connect your iPhone or iPod touch to your computer.

   i. If it does not synch automatically and attempt to install your 
      new beta app, click on the icon under Devices in the iTunes 
      left hand column.
    
   ii. Once you have the device selected, Click on its Applications 
       tab in iTunes. You should see the app you are beta testing in 
       the grayed out list with the checkboxes. Make sure Sync 
       applications is checked, and All applications is selected. (if 
       you are using checkboxes, you need to make sure BlueTap is 
       checked, along with all the other apps you want to keep on your 
       device)

   iii. Click the Sync button in the lower right and watch the top 
        bar. You should eventually see it installing the 
        application on your device.
